# Project Description: Investment FOMO Time Machine & Regret Calculator

**Addressing Investment FOMO with an Engaging and Educational Web Application**

The "Investment FOMO Time Machine & Regret Calculator" is a full-stack Spring Boot web application designed to address the common phenomenon of "Fear of Missing Out" (FOMO) in investing. This project goes beyond a simple calculator, offering an entertaining and informative experience that allows users to:

- **Explore "What If" Scenarios:** Utilize an "Investment Time Machine" to retrospectively calculate hypothetical returns on various assets (stocks, crypto, etc.) over custom date ranges.
- **Visualize "Missed Gains" in a Relatable Way:** Experience the potential impact of investment timing through the "Pain Scale Visualizer," which translates missed profits into relatable metrics like "pizzas missed" or "vacations forgone."
- **Engage with Humor and Gamification:** Generate shareable investment regret memes, adding a lighthearted and memorable element to the learning experience.
- **Learn from Market History:** Gain a better understanding of market cycles and the impact of investment timing in a non-intimidating way.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive "Investment Time Machine":** Allows users to select assets, date ranges, and investment amounts to simulate historical investment performance.
- **"Pain Scale Visualizer":** Translates potential missed profits into relatable and humorous metrics, enhancing user engagement.
