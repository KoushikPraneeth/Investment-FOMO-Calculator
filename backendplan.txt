Backend Phase 2 Plan: API Integration with Frontend & CORS Configuration (1-2 days)

Goal: Establish a working end-to-end connection between your Bolt.new frontend and your Spring Boot backend API, specifically for the /api/calculate endpoint. This includes configuring CORS in Spring Boot to allow cross-origin requests from your frontend.

Tasks:

Determine Your Bolt.new Frontend Development URL:

Start your Bolt.new frontend application in development mode (npm run dev or similar command in Bolt.new).

Look at the console output or the browser address bar to find the exact URL and port where your Bolt.new frontend is running. It's likely something like http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:3000, but it could be different depending on Bolt.new's configuration. Note down this URL. This is your frontend's origin.

Configure CORS in Spring Boot InvestmentController:

Open your InvestmentController.java (or Kotlin) file in your Spring Boot project.

Add the @CrossOrigin annotation at the class level for your InvestmentController. This will apply CORS configuration to all endpoints in this controller.

Set the origins parameter in @CrossOrigin to your Bolt.new frontend URL you noted down in step 1.

// InvestmentController.java (Example - Java)
package com.example.fomo.fomocalculatorbackend.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:5173") // Replace with YOUR Bolt.new frontend URL
public class InvestmentController {
    // ... your /api/calculate endpoint method ...
}
Use code with caution.
Java
Important: Replace "http://localhost:5173" in the origins parameter with the actual URL of your Bolt.new frontend application. Make sure it's exactly correct, including http:// or https:// and the port number.

Update Frontend API Service URL:

Open your frontend code in Bolt.new.

Go to your API service file (likely src/services/api.ts based on your previous code).

Modify the API_BASE_URL variable to point to your Spring Boot backend's URL. If you are running your Spring Boot backend locally on port 8080, and assuming your backend API base path is /api, then set it to:

// src/services/api.ts (Example)
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080/api'; // Point to your Spring Boot backend URL
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Ensure the port number (8080 in this example) matches the port your Spring Boot application is running on.

Run Both Frontend and Backend Applications:

Start your Spring Boot backend application in your IDE. Make sure it is running without errors and listening on port 8080 (or your configured port).

Start your Bolt.new frontend application in development mode (npm run dev or similar).

Test End-to-End Connection through Frontend UI:

Open your Bolt.new frontend application in your web browser (using the URL from Bolt.new dev server).

Log in to your application (using the Supabase authentication you implemented).

Perform an Investment Calculation:

Select an asset from the AssetDropdown.

Choose an entry and exit date using the DateRangePicker.

Enter an investment amount in the AmountInput.

Click the "Calculate Returns" button.

Observe the Results Display:

Successful Connection: If the connection is working correctly, you should see the ResultsDisplay component update and display real calculated investment results fetched from your Spring Boot backend API (not mock data anymore!). You should see the asset name, entry price, exit price, profit/loss, percentage, and Pain Scale metrics.

Troubleshooting Connection Issues: If you don't see results, or you see errors in the frontend UI or browser console, proceed to the "Debugging Connection Issues" section below.

Verify Data Flow and Accuracy:

Check Browser Developer Tools (Network Tab):

Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12).

Go to the "Network" tab.

Perform another investment calculation in your frontend.

Look for a network request in the "Network" tab that corresponds to your API call to /api/calculate. It should be a GET request to http://localhost:8080/api/calculate (or your backend URL).

Examine the Request: Check the "Headers" and "Params" of the request to ensure that your frontend is sending the correct parameters (symbol, entryDate, exitDate, amount) to the backend API.

Examine the Response:

Status Code: Verify that the response status code is 200 OK, indicating a successful request.

Response Body: Look at the "Response" or "Preview" tab to examine the JSON response body. Confirm that the response contains the InvestmentResult data in the expected JSON format, with actual calculated values for prices, profit/loss, and Pain Scale metrics.

If you see a different status code (like 4xx or 5xx), or an error response body, or no response at all, it indicates a connection problem. Check the "Debugging Connection Issues" section below.

Check Spring Boot Backend Logs:

Look at the console output or log file of your running Spring Boot backend application.

Verify that your backend received the API request: You should see log messages from your InvestmentController and CalculationService indicating that the /api/calculate endpoint was hit, and that the calculation process started.

Look for any error messages or exceptions in the backend logs. Backend logs are crucial for diagnosing issues on the server-side.
Phase 2 Deliverables:

Frontend URL identified.

CORS configured in Spring Boot InvestmentController using @CrossOrigin with your frontend URL.

Frontend API service API_BASE_URL updated to point to Spring Boot backend.

Both Frontend and Backend applications running.

End-to-end connection tested through frontend UI for /api/calculate endpoint.

Successful data flow verified (frontend -> backend -> financial API -> backend -> frontend).

Browser developer tools (Network tab) and Spring Boot backend logs used for debugging and verification.

CORS issues resolved (if any).
